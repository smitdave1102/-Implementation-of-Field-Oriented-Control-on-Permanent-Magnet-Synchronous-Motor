#  Implementation of Field Oriented Control on Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor

Abstract

This paper proposes the control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor through Field Oriented Control algorithm coded on an
FPGA controller which can be used in electric vehicles. Field Oriented Control method was chosen as it was found to be useful for
electric vehicles for speed control. The paper details the implementation of Field Oriented Control on PMSM using MATLAB and
Xilinx. The Hardware setup is 2 level IGBT inverter, FPGA controller and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor. Results obtained
from practical implementation show that Field Oriented Control was successfully implemented. The speed control of PMSM was
achieved and also the objectives of simulating the above scenario and observing power losses was accomplished. The FOC simulation of
MATLAB shows system behaving similarly to the set point reference inputs given by the user.
